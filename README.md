# HotAI

## Introduction

Are you sick of looksmaxing without aim. Are you tired of having zero hoes or man hoes (yeah we inclusive). I know I am! So I think the solution is not to work on your personality or people skills, but rather obsess over every minute detail of your looks. HotAI will be the perfect companion, there to point out your every flaw and propose fixes.

## Value/Use

This application will work wonders in making you understand that it was most likely over before it already began. It will use cutting edge ai tools to determine that you, in fact, will remain bitchless because you have prey eyes and a negative canthel tilt.

## User Interaction and Experience

Just snap a photo in a snap chat like ui and let ai do the rest, have a lil loading bar like those anime girl snap chat filters (I wouldnt know) so you can tell that the ai is workin its magic :3. Once ai done processing your ugly ass, there should be green rectangles on areas of interest, and an out of ten rating attached on the bottom of the photo. When clicking on the rectangles, it will tell you what you did wrong, and how to fix it. Like if you have a weak jaw, it will point it out, and reccomend bone smashing!

## Competitive Element

There will be an export feature to export your rating and looks stats to other social media. There can also be a transcript of your good looking traits and bad. This will make kids wanna share this cause idk mfs are stupid. Also it would be pretty fun for a solid two minutes, but tbh like a videogame would get stale after 1 so Im just puttin that out there.

## Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies

To get repeat engagment, we can make it so you can post your scores, so you gon wanna see your friends scores! And we could have a leaderboard of hottest and a leaderboard of uggos! Also, we can encourage usage during different times of the day, with and without makeup, to truly rate them ratchet mfs.

## Scalability and Expansion

Ads ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘. Also we can paywall some of the features, and make it a snap chat and tik tok filter so we can leave a positive impact on the world yay!!!!!

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

We all know ai can be racist sometimes, especially with image detection, sorryðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”, we gon do our best to train it to not be racist so we can make more money!!ðŸ¤‘

We will allow everyone on our app yay!!!!
